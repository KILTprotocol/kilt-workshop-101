# KILT SDK Tutorial  

Welcome, curious mind!   

The KILT SDK...

===

In this tutorial, you will:   

✅ Get familiar with KILT's essential concepts and what they mean: `CTYPE`, `Claim`, `Attester`, and `Verifier`;   
✅ Learn how to create an Identity with the KILT-SDK;   
✅ Use the KILT-SDK for three different roles: you'll create a claim as a Claimer, attest it as an Attester, and verify is as a Verifier.    

=== 

To do so, we'll take the case of a Driver's License.  
1. See how a given user can make a Claim about themselves,  
   then 
2. Look at how other actors can attest it,  
   and finally
3. See how this Claim can be verified.
