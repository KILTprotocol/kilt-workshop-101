# KILT Tutorial  

Welcome, curious mind!    
KILT's [sdk-js](https://kiltprotocol.github.io/kilt-workshop-101/#/) is an SDK that helps you use verifiable claims in your application. 

In this tutorial, you will:   

âœ… Get familiar with KILT's essential concepts: `CTYPE`, `Claim`, `Attester`, and `Verifier`;   
âœ… Learn how to create an identity;   
âœ… Use the SDK for three different cases: 
* You'll create a claim as a <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span>; 
* Attest it as an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>;
* Verify it as a <span class="label-role verifier">verifier</span>.  


Estimated time: **45 minutes**.   

Let's go!
