# âœ… Verification

In this section, you'll play the role of a <span class="label-role verifier">verifier</span>:

* You'll take an `AttestedClaim` object given to you by a <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span>;
* You'll verify that its data is correct;
* You'll verify that the attestation is valid (= its hash exists on-chain and the attestation is not revoked).

> ðŸ’¡ An `AttestedClaim` object is also called a Credential: it is what <span class="label-role claimer">claimers</span> present to <span class="label-role verifier">verifiers</span> upon request.

## Get an `AttestedClaim` object

You can either:

* Take the `AttestedClaim` object you've generated in the previous step as an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>;
* Or if you're in a workshop, ask another participant to send you their `AttestedClaim` object.  

In the following, we'll refer to it as `<attestedClaimJSONString>`.

## Create a file

Create a new file `verification.js`.  
All of the code for this step needs to go into this file.

## Code: verify

Paste the following code in `verification.js`:

```javascript
const Kilt = require('@kiltprotocol/sdk-js')

// create an attested claim from the JSON string
const attestedClaimStruct = JSON.parse('<attestedClaimJSONString>');
const attestedClaim = Kilt.AttestedClaim.fromAttestedClaim(attestedClaimStruct);

// connect to the KILT blockchain
Kilt.default.connect('wss://full-nodes.kilt.io:9944')

// verify:
// - verify that the data is valid for the given CTYPE;
// - verify on-chain that the attestation hash is present and that the attestation is not revoked.
attestedClaim.verify().then(isValid => {
  console.log('isValid: ', isValid)
}).finally(() => {
  Kilt.default.disconnect()
})
```

## Run

Run the code by running this command in your terminal, still within your `kilt-rocks` directory:

```bash
node verification.js
```

In your logs, you should see chain queries and successful verification (`isValid: true`).

That's it!
You've successfully verified a claim as a <span class="label-role verifier">verifier</span>.

Or... did you? ðŸ˜ˆ
