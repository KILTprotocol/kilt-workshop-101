# ðŸ’¬ Claim

In this section, you'll play the role of a <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span>.

* You'll first make a claim about yourself in the form of a `Claim` object;
* But a claim in itself has no value. To become valid in the eyes of <span class="label-role verifier">verifiers</span>, it needs to be attested by an entity that <span class="label-role verifier">verifiers</span> trust: an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>. So you'll create a `RequestForAttestation` object from your `Claim` object, so that an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span> can attest it.

We'll look into the attestation in the next steps - for now, let's just focus on your claim.

> ðŸ’¡ KILT is an open system.
> Anyone/anything can make a claim about themselves. But a claim only has value if the verifier trusts the attester.

## Create a file

Create a new file `2-claim.js`.
All of the code for this step needs to go into this file.

## Code: create a claim

In the previous step, you've generated two mnemonics and identities.
You'll now need the first mnemonic you've created; it's referred to as `<CLAIMER'S MNEMONIC>` in the code snippet below.

We'll create a claim using the provided CTYPE and the claimer identity.  
Paste the following in `2-claim.js`. Make sure to replace the `<CLAIMER'S MNEMONIC>`.

```javascript
const Kilt = require('@kiltprotocol/sdk-js')

// import the claim type file we've created previously
const ctype = require('./ctype.json')

// `<CLAIMER'S MNEMONIC>` is for example "gold upset segment cake universe carry demand comfort dawn invite element capital"
const mnemonic = `<CLAIMER'S MNEMONIC>`
const claimer = Kilt.Identity.buildFromMnemonic(mnemonic)

const claimContents = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
}

const claim = Kilt.Claim.fromCTypeAndClaimContents(
  ctype,
  claimContents,
  claimer.address,
  null
);
```

## Code: create the `RequestForAttestation` object  

Now that you have your claim, you want to sign it and prepare it for the <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>.
To do so, let's build a `RequestForAttestation` object.

Append the following code to `2-claim.js`:

```javascript
const requestForAttestation = Kilt.RequestForAttestation.fromClaimAndIdentity(
  claim,
  claimer,
  []
);

// log this so you can paste it locally
console.log(JSON.stringify(requestForAttestation))
```

## Run

Execute the file by running this command in your terminal, still within your `kilt-rocks` directory:

```bash
node 2-claim.js
```  

This outputs your `RequestForAttestation` object.

Copy and paste it somewhere: we'll need it in the next step to get it attested by an <span class="label-role attester">attester</span>.

> In a real-life setup, the different actors - claimer, attester and verifier - communicate with each other via a messaging system and can rely on the KILT SDK's messaging capabilities.
> 
> We don't need to do this here.
> 
> If you're following this tutorial on your own, you're playing all three KILT roles: claimer, attester and verifier. So you can simply copy the outputs of the different functions you're calling and use them as inputs for the other actors.
> 
> If you're following this as a workshop, you can simulate message exchange by exchanging your requests via chat, email, or simply by pasting requests for attestations or attested claims in a shared document such as [this hackmd](https://hackmd.io/c6OBNgWWR8yWJhMj7WICUA?edit).

OK, you've made a claim as a <span class="label-role claimer">claimer</span> and created a request for attestation.

Let's switch roles and get this attested!
