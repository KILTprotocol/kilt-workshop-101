# Prerequisites  

A few things, before we can get started.

## Node.js
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.   
The stable (LTS) version is sufficient.

## Your working folder
Create a new folder, named for example `kilt-rocks`.       
This is where we'll be doing work for the rest of this tutorial.   

## KILT-SDK 
Navigate into your newly created folder (`kilt-rocks`).    
 
Install the KILT-SDK by running the following commands:  

```bash
npm init -y
npm i @kiltprotocol/sdk-js
``` 

Or with `yarn`:   
```bash
yarn init -y
yarn add @kiltprotocol/sdk-js
```  

That's it for the basic setup - We're good to go!
