title: fix code snippets after sdk-js upgrade
labels: bug
---

_Note: This issue was **automatically created** because the code snippet CI pipeline broke after an update in the SDK on {{ date | date('YYYY-MM-D')}}._

Please **fix both the test- and workshop-snippets inside this workshop repository** for which the CI broke after pushing [{{ env.SHA }}]({{ env.URL }}) on the develop branch of the SDK.
**You do not have to fix something in the SDK!**
This issue just displays a (workshop) breaking change was made to the SDK.
